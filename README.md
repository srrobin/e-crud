## Technologies Used
1. **React**: The core framework for building the user interface.
2. **React Bootstrap**: Used for UI components to ensure a responsive design and consistent styling.
3. **i18next and react-i18next**: Employed for language localization, enabling users to switch between different languages seamlessly.
4. **Context API**: Utilized for managing light and dark mode themes throughout the application.
5. **React Router DOM**: Implemented for client-side routing, allowing navigation between different pages without reloading the entire app.
6. **Axios**: Integrated for making HTTP requests, particularly for fetching and updating data from the backend API.
7. **react-pdf/renderer**: Utilized for generating PDF documents, such as exporting blog posts or product details.
8. **TanStack Query (formerly React Query)**: Simplifies server state management by streamlining API requests, handling pending/error states, and providing features like background refetching and pagination.
9. **pnpm**: Chosen as the package manager for dependency management, offering a faster and more efficient alternative to npm or yarn.
